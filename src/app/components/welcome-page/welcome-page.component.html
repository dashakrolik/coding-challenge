    <h1>Welcome to the Ordina coding challenge!</h1>
    <p>
        In this challenge you get a chance to test your coding skills and compare yourself to some of our most
        experienced developers. In this game you get to score points by answering questions and coding solutions to
        intricate problems. These points decide your place on the leaderboard where you can see how your skills stack
        up!<br>
        This challenge is made for fun. It is for you to see how high up the leaderboard your skills place you and not
        for anyone else (except for bragging rights for me, because obviously the #1 spot is mine).
